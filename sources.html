      <p id = "bosText"> Priceless resource for getting into shaders and understanding some more of the foundations of computer art. 
        Goes from the very basics all the way up to fractal brownian motion. It has been left in an unfinished state for years which is a huge bummer, but the chapters 
        that are available are great. Explains things very incrementaly that doesn't feel overwhelming.
